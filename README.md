# Localization
we consider a computer vision as a technique that uses deep learning model in order to localize the coordinate of balls in images by using existing UNet architecture and fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) architecture. The neural network can be trained from scratch in 6 hours with digital images as training data in order for the model to learn and gain a high-level localization a ball that exists in an image. The dataset to feed the model was collected from the internet.
